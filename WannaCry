WannaCry (also known as WCry or WanaCryptor) is a self-propagating ransomware that spreads through internal networks and over the public internet by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, MS17-010. The WannaCry malware consists of two distinct components: one that provides ransomware functionality and another used for propagation, which includes SMB exploitation capabilities.
  The malware leverages an exploit, codenamed "EternalBlue," released by the Shadow Brokers on April 14, 2017.
  WannaCry appends encrypted data files with the .WCRY extension, drops and executes a decryptor tool, and demands $300 or $600 USD (via Bitcoin) to decrypt the data.
  The malware uses encrypted Tor channels for command and control (C2) communications.


Persistence Mechanism
  The malware creates the following two registry run keys to ensure persistence:
  Key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\<Random>
  Value: <Full_path>\tasksche.exe

  Key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\<Random>
  Value: <Full_path>\tasksche.exe

  The malware creates the following service to ensure persistence of mssecsvc.exe:

  ServiceName: mssecsvc2.0
  DisplayName: Microsoft Security Center (2.0) Service
  BinaryPath: <path to mssecsvc> -m security
  The malware creates the following service to ensure persistence of tasksche.exe

  ServiceName: <8-15lower><3number>
  DisplayName: <Same as Service Name>
  BinaryPath <path to tashsche.exe>

WannaCry Analysis
Startup
The malware starts by attempting to connect to the following domain with InternetOpenUrl:

www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com
NOTE: If this succeeds, the malware immediately exits. For a list of observed killswitch domains, see Appendix A.

If the connection fails, however, the malware checks the number of arguments passed to the program. If zero, the malware continues with installation; otherwise it enters service mode.

Note: Network proxies and other enterprise network security features may prevent the malware from contacting its killswitch domain and inadvertently trigger encryption. Organizations may wish to adjust their proxy configurations or other network configurations to avoid this problem.

Service Mode
In service mode, the malware first updates the service config so that failure actions occur if the service exits without entering a SERVICE_STOPPED state. The malware then executes the service function, which registers the service handlers and attempts exploitation of MS17-010 against identified SMB services. This allows remote code execution and enables spreading across the network. This execution is performed in a thread, and the service exits after 24 hours regardless of the status of the thread.

The spreader begins by setting up the Windows socket APIs and generating a RSA crypto context. This crypto context is later used to generate random numbers. The malware then builds two DLLs in memory â€“ they are 32 and 64-bit DLLs that have identical functionality. Each one contains a single export named PlayGame that loads the W resource, writes it to C:\WINDOWS\mssecsvc.exe, and executes it. The W resource in each case has been populated with a copy of the running binary (MD5: db349b97c37d22f5ea1d1841e3c89eb4).

The malware continues by spawning two threads, the first thread enumerates the network adapters and determines which subnets the system is on. The malware then generates a thread for each IP on the subnet. Each of these threads attempts to connect to the IP on port 445 and, if successful, attempts exploitation of the service via a vulnerability described in MS17-010. An example of an attempt to exploit MS17-010 on a remote system can be seen in Figure 1.
